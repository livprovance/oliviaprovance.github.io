## Olivia Provance

Hi there! Iâ€™m Olivia, a PhD candidate in the department of cancer biology working in the lab of [Dr. Joan Lewis-Wambi] (http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/cancer-biology/faculty/joan-lewis-wambi-phd.html) at the University of Kansas Medical Center.
<p>
My dissertation is focused on defining the role of interferon stimulated factors in triple-negative breast cancer. I run gels to answer scientific questions and run marathons to keep myself sane.
<p>
Here you will find a mix of academic achievements, pictures of my dog, and marathon motivation.
<p>
Thanks for visiting!
